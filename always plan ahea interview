always plan ahea (@alwaysplanahea1) interview stuff

The questions:

Do you feel like enemy teams banning A-Sol everygame made drafts easier for SN? 
Like would it lighten the load on team mates who might have got a target ban?
Or would it mean a power pick gets through for you guys to snag?
When A-Sol did get through first ban phase how often would you roughly say you would end up picking it? 

That's all I got, but if you wanna add anything else you feel fit feel free too! I'll be using them for the part where I discuss the differences between champions with different playerbase types

Responses:

It for sure made atleast the first half of pick/ban easier with them banning asol every game
It would make it so that we could draft around getting certain picks because we only know that they are working with at most 2 bans
And if asol got through we would always pick him on the first phase of picking either 2/3 on blue or 3 on red
