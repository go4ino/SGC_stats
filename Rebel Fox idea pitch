1: og twitter pitch

"I'd be interested in seeing the comparison of champion KDA compared to the density of players playing any given champion.
I would guess inverse correlation due to specific champion mastery increasing performance level. 
Might be a good indicator of the viability of champions"


2: follow up discord dms to clarify

ayyo :b:ebel :b:ox if you get the chance can you elaborate on your suggestion from yesterday? it seems interesting but not entirely sure whatchu meanin

Rebel Fox07/25/2020
Sure

So what you have atm is the KDA of specific supports. Obviously certain supports will have differing KDAs based on their champion kit etc.

I was curious about the distribution of champion play allotted vs KDA to get an idea of how specific champions KDA changed based on the number of people who play it. 

For example if we compared Naut, Bard, and Sona

Naut has a very high distribution of play since he's exceptionally common among most supports.

Bard has a few players that play consistently and then a few random games here and there

Sona is played exclusively by Dean 

I'd like to see how their KDAs change as a result of the number of players increasing

so basically how # of unique players effects wr?
i can do that ya look for linear / w/e trends
would have to define what counts as wide playerbase vs one or 2 ppl who have it as a pocket pick but shouldnt be bad from there i think?

Rebel Fox07/25/2020
Sure. Doesn't even need defining, so long as you get a correlative value between #and else

Go4ino07/25/2020
yeah maybe idk needa get the data into excel first which is a big meme of a time

Rebel Fox07/25/2020
Fair

Go4ino07/25/2020
did you wanna see just support data or all data for all positions

Rebel Fox07/25/2020
