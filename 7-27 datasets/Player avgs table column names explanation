Included this to explain the columns since I kinda organized and named them shittly lol

If a variable has 'X' in it, that's just A-Sol/Sona/Nunu/Jinx depending on which player.

Metric_name_og: the original code friendly variable name for each of the metrics from 'all role champs 7-27.csv'

Metric: is Metric_name_og but made reader friendly for tables 2-5.

With_X: overall averages for the player with all champs included. I originally was using this to compare to no_X, but I realized after I had made the tables on display 
and written some analysis that that was a pepega on my part and I had to re-edit them all over again.

X_only: metric averages for only games on their signature champ.

no_x: averages for the players without their signature champ included.

raw_dif: With_x - no_x. (unused)

perc_dif: With_x / no_x. (unused)

with_rnd: With_X but rounded to 4 decimals. (unused)

without_rnd: no_x but rounded to 4 decimals.

raw_dif_rnd: raw_dif but rounded to 4 decimals. (unused)

ratio_rnd: perc_dif but rounded to 4 decimals. (unused)

As_x_rnd: X_only but rounded to 4 decimals. (Turns out all these values were already rounded to under 4 decimals but i didnt realize till after rip.)

raw_dif2: X_only - no_x

raw_dif2: X_only / no_x

raw_dif2_rnd: raw_dif2 but rounded to 4 decimals.

perc_dif2_rn: raw_dif2 but rounded to 4 decimals.
